# Traffic Intersection Simulation using Multithreading

This C++ program simulates the movement of cars at a traffic intersection using multithreading. The intersection consists of two roads: one with two lanes and the other with four lanes. The input data includes a list of car numbers, their directions, and a list of times when they pass through the intersection.

## Description

The program utilizes multithreading to simulate the movement of cars at the intersection. Each car is represented as a thread, and synchronization mechanisms are used to manage the flow of traffic at the intersection. The simulation provides a realistic depiction of how cars navigate through the intersection based on their directions and arrival times.

## Inputs

- The user needs to provide the following input data:
  - List of car numbers.
  - Directions for each car.
  - List of times when each car passes through the intersection.
